My own personal website. Project to production


Todo
-----------
- design/create about me page
- design/create projects page
- figure out how to scale p5js canvases properly so that it's based off of viewport
  -issue: if the page if refreshed with the dev console open, canvas doesn't full render.
- once above is fixed, redo the enter button on landing page
