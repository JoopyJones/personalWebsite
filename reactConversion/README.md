# personalWebsite-Conversion to React
My own personal website, but in React! WIP


Todo
-----------
- create component for navigation links ( and maybe have my picture and "Hi" message here too for all pages)
- create thumbnail versions of photos to load into the lejoop component instead of full size files
- implement image popup when lejoop images are clicked, expand to images full size with max size of screen. 
- make sure css is cleaned up
